Description:
Weâ€™ve created a trail finder app that shows trails based on limited search criteria, whereby users can select a trail that matches their desired area, length, difficulty level, etc. We created this application to inspire our community of fellow outdoor enthusiasts who love of an adventure.

  - Materialize CSS Framework
  - Local Storage (Store User Data)
      - Populates embedded trail details widget from Hiking Project
      - Populates embedded weather widget from lat/long data
      - Data persistence to compile a checklist
  - Google Maps API
  
  Projected Added Features
  - Saved Searches and Saved Checklists w/ email functionality
  - Ability to revisit your Saved lists and comment on the trail
  - Add Google Directions functionality and time of arrival from Google Maps
  - Map markers for provisions (checklist items) using Google Places
  - Filters in search results
  - Collect user photos/reviews with optional social media plugins to share
  - Add other hikes nearby to Trail Details page
  - Add nearby campsites using Camp America API
  - Incorporate ride-share for users to connect and carpool to trailheads
